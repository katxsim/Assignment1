    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>I am a coffee lover! I've tried coffee from many places in the world, but I hope to try even more. So far the weirdest coffee I've had is Kopi Luwak in Bali, whicih is the world’s most expensive coffee! It earns its pricey distinction thanks to a surprising step in its production: digestion. In Indonesia, a wild animal known as the Asian palm civet (a small critter similar to the weasel) cannot resist the bright red coffee cherries that abound, even though they can’t digest the actual coffee beans. The beans pass through the civets' systems without being fully digested. At which point, some brave coffee farmer collects the beans from the civets’ droppings, (hopefully) thoroughly washes them, and sells them for up to $600 per pound. </p>
    <p>I love nature, animals, technology, and building cool stuff with code.</p>
